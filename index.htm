<h1>DAAD RISE Journal</h1>
<a href="file:///C:/Users/NJPC1/Desktop/index.htm">Introduction</a>
<h2> Introduction </h2> 
<p style="color:blue"> This serves as a Journal for myself and others to read about my wonderful experience in Germany during the summer of 2019. The DAAD RISE program sponsored me to do a biochemistry research project. Here are my experiences and thoughts on the excursion <p>

<br> <i> The best way to read this is by zooming on your browser press ( CTRL + ) multiple times.</i> <br/>

<h2> Forward </h2>

<p> <br> I first found out about this through a poster I saw on the third floor of the SUNY Geneseo science center. As soon as I saw the poster for the DAAD RISE program I was determined to get it. It combines two things I love, German culture/language and Biomedical Research. <br/>

<br> I applied to three projects in the Fall of 2018 and was accepted to my top ranked project on Febuary 20th 2019, thanks be to god. <br/>

<br> Lots of stress came with applying as I would wake up everyday scared to see if I would get the acceptance email or not. The email came early on a Wednesday morning (5 am about), I may or may not have freaked out. I remember thinking: everything I worked so hard for, these past years I struggled through balancing hard courses and extracurriculars/research have paid off. <br/>

<br>I was matched to the Laboratory Project of Lisa Linck-Paulus M.S. 
Lisa is a PhD Student at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU) Faculty of Medicine Institute of Biochemistry. <br> <p/>

<h2> Preparation for the Trip </h2>
<p> I scrambled at first to figure out what I was doing. The DAAD tells us to wait some time after acceptance before they actually tell us what is going on. They send a nice packet of stuff including what they do for us money-wise, travel-wise, health insurance, what forms to fill out etc. Then I quickly purchased a plane ticket, which is very important. The DAAD gives money for a two-way plane ticket but it is a set price depending on your region. I got the ticket a bit cheaper and had to pay with my own money, as the DAAD only transfers money around the start of the internship to a german bank account.

<br>I set up an account with the online bank N26, the best bank for students in my mind due to its accesibility (they just send a card and have an online money managing system) . The DAAD quickly transferred me money before arriving to Germany, a pleasant suprise. <br/> 
<br> Overall packing and everything was pretty standard, given that I have traveled some before. I had to buy a new suitcase because the one I had was small. One thing I had to take into consideration is lab clothes vs. street clothes. Luckily I am working in a molecular biology/genetics research lab so I can wear a lab coat and get away with wearing nice-ish clothes. I packed separate clothes to wear in the lab and clothes to wear when out. I also packed sneakers for the lab and a journal for myself to write down protocols etc. I packed standard hygiene stuff, my computer, MCAT books and some fancy clothes for the DAAD RISE 2 day conference in Heidelberg, Germany. <br/>
</p>

<h2> Travel </h2> 
<p> <br> After miraculously surviving the 5 finals I had the spring semester of 2019, I packed everything I needed for the trip and spent some days with my uncle who came from Mexico. I then left Rochester Airport and traveled to JFK. From JFK I went to Frankfurt on Singapore Airlines.   <br/>
<br> <img src="2B3590FE-C397-4269-8BD8-A8F393977169.jpg" alt="_" width="300" height="300" style="transform:rotate(90deg);"><br/>

<br> In my opinion, Singapore Airlines is an awesome and cheap way to get to Germany. I remember getting on the air bus (it was a larger airplane, called an airbus by the airline), I was greeted by these very nice asian ladies, who greeted me much like in the movies, by bowing to me and greeting me in broken english. After sitting in my aisle seat, I settled in and enjoyed the small tablet/TV device mounted in the seat. The seat admittedly did not have the amount of legroom I desired, but I am 6 foot something. And then ahhh, the food on any flight is something I always am looking forward to, maybe because the flight causes lots of anxiety in me I I control that through food-lust. At any rate, we were offerred standard beverages at first and also a hot towel. I have never been offerred a hot towel on a plane before but I guess everyone else knew how to use them but me. I just copied other passangers, who washed their hands and faces with said hot towel. I was next to a young german couple and talked to them for a bit during the flight. We then were served dinner on the flight. Dinner was either chicken or fish, I chose chicken. It was served in this small tray along with kartoffeln (potatoes) and bread, butter, coleslaw, a fresh water cup, and a brick of cheddar cheese. I enjoyed it, probably because I was hungry, even though it was pretty terrible quality. After dinner we got a cup of haagen daas ice cream, the highlight of the flight. The airline people should probably be more careful with how they freeze the ice cream, because it was as solid as a brick. I spent almost half an hour trying to melt this stiff brick of ice cream with my spoon and cradling the cup with my hand to see if I could produce enough heat to melt it. After chomping that down, I went to sleep for a few hours and we then arrived at frankfurt.
<br> <img src="IMG_0526.jpg" alt="IMG" width="300" height="300" ><br/> 
  
<br> Here is a big thing to think about, Germany has a 6 hour time difference from New York, so going ahead in time sucks. It takes adjustment and losing some hours of sleep. After arriving at Frankfurt I quickly got my stuff and ran off to immigration to leave the airport find the Flix Bus Terminal. Flix Bus is a very cheap form of transportation in Germany and many recommend it there. Immigration was quite lax for me, and checked my passport and after telling the officer I was a DAAD student he said that I am good to go quickly (perks, I guess, of this program). <br/>

<br> It is so amazing. So amazing to think that I am back in this wonderful country that I love. I immediatley recognized parts of the airport both inside and outside. I used my not-so-great German to talk to some people in the airport to ask for directions to the Flix Bus terminal. And I finally remembered something importamt, germans speak too fast for the untrained ear. I could understand a few words hear and there they told me for directions, but I was hopelessly lost when I actually began to look for the flix bus terminal. I finally found it through some searching and waited for the bus. Now, I did not expect the terminal to be the way it was but it was that way. There were some normal travelers as society would call them, and some not so normal travelers. Some people were smoking and drinking in the terminal, they had long hair and heavy-metal band shirts on. Others sat with their shirts off, mind you the terminal is outside, and one man had a huge cyst on his back. I guess he really wanted us all to look at his cyst. I got on the bus and I almost immediately fell asleep. <br/>
  
  
I was tired due to jet lag I think and I just sent a message to my Research advisor Lisa (the bus has wifi) and went to sleep. I woke up about one stop before I had to get off at Nuremberg (thank god) and got off and waited for Lisa. She said a few weeks before she would pick me up with her husband and drive me to my apartment in Erlangen. I got off at the Flix-Bus terminal in Nuremberg and quickly sent Lisa a message. I waited there about 10 minutes or so, looking around to see if she was there. I then glanced at my phone to see what time it was and heard a voice. I looked up and it was Lisa. I remember being a bit startled, but I shook her hand and we went to her car, where I introduced myself to her husband as well. We got into this classic volkwagen car (popular in Germany I presume), and drove to Erlangen. We talked about the trip and my ventures in the car and Lisa was to bring me to the supermarkt as well before she dropped me off at my apartment (I am writing from my apartment right now). She speaks very fast german, her husband as well and most of it I admittedly could not understand. I can speak german and make others understand me, but I guess when someone talks to me in German it is a bit more difficult. I truly value however, the education I recieved in German from high-school as it probably helped me more than the short duo-lingo course I have on my phone. We got to the supermarkt, Aldi. Great! There is also Aldi in the U.S., and I bought some waters, detergent,soap for washing myself, and also food. I had no idea what to buy myself for food, so I ended up buying some bread and salami to make it through to Monday (I arrived saturday). Unfortunately, most German Supermarkets close on Sundays, so I had to shop on saturday. Bakeries on the other hand, are open and luckily I had on nearby my apartment. Lisa dropped me off at my apartment where I met one of my flatmates, Jonas, who is a medical student at FAU. Luckily he speaks english, but I had to try and explain in german that I wanted to speak english for full understandingI settled in. Interestingly enough he grew up in Michigan from the age of 1-8 years. Now, I imagined I would be sad seeing the place where I would stay for the next 10 weeks, and missing home. But I just felt excited/stressed. Stressed because the MCAT (medical college admission test) looms around the corner. This test is a make or break for me, and I frankly should be studying for it rather than writing this blog. At any rate, I started my laboratory internship on Monday, May 20th. <br/> 
 <p/>
<h2> Day 1 </h2>
<p> I could not sleep all sunday night. I am not sure if I was anxious or nervous but I could not fall asleep. I then took a shower and got ready Monday morning, without feeling very tired strangely enough. I got some breakfast from the nearby bäckerei, Der Beck. Der Beck is a stones throw from my apartment. I am used to my usual monday morning breakfast sandwiches from geneseo, with a bagel, egg, cheese and sausage. I did not really know what to buy at Der beck. On one hand I could not fully understand the menu, and on the other hand there were so many options. I decided on a breakfast special they had. I ordered in my broken german (yes it is not the best) and paid with my fancy wallet now full of euros thanks to the DAAD. And I waited for my breakfast. Der Beck is a very nice bakery with fancy furniture for dining. I finally got my plate, which had a piece of ham, salami, two pieces of sliced bread (not the normal supermarket kind but from a bread loaf), butter, jam (erdbeer marmelade), and two pieces of this very salty bread that I picked out (you get to pick two pieces of bread). Now, I like salt. It gives some good flavor to everything, but I like it in moderation. What I have learned is the german bretzels, and some other salz-brötchen use big salt crystals which pack a huge punch. I was not used to this flavor, so I got knocked out in the first round. I buttered my bread, ate the meat and was ready for my first day of research. <br/>
<br><img src="IMG_0585.jpg" alt="IMG" width="300" height="300"  ><br/>
<br>I went back to my apartment where lisa was to pick me up. She showed up bright and early and brought the bike I was to ride to work everyday, and we walked to the laboratory. Erlangen is absolutely beautiful. I honestly can not describe the sentiment this experience has brought about in me. Seeing Germany again was a blessing, for I love all of the great memories I have in this country. The tall houses are all carefully layed out and organized near my apartment, with very sharp rooves. The traditional german decor of these houses astounded me, for I just spent the last two years of my life in a boring university, with flat ugly lecture halls and a dark gloomy library. We passed through the park and a bridge that goes over the Regnitz river, which goes through the city of Erlangen. We then got to the inner city, and I had to stop and think about how I define the word city. Growing up in a rural area, I was raised to think of the city as this scary, dark monster that gobbles up innocent people and spits them out angry, impatient, and greedy. I remember my trip to NYC as a child, I wanted to enjoy the experience, but the cold grey city blocks and street people scared me. My previous encounter with German cities must have been pushed back into my deep forgotten memories, because I was suprised to see the beauty of the city of Erlangen. As I walked down the cobble stone streets, I caught a glimpse of the amazing traditional German decor, I smelled baking bread from the many Bäckerei, and the laboratory. I conversed with Lisa as we walked to the institute over the research project and finally arrived at the institute. The Institute of Biochemistry is part of the Medical School at FAU. Medical students in Germany can be quite young, since they come out of high school directly into medical school. So I arrived and was confused to see young students (I expected them to be bachelors students). The institute is a large complex, and a break from the traditional decor I have been aweing over. I stepped inside and went up to the lab. I got two labcoats, one for cell culture and one for bench research. Lisa and I then talked about her project and methods and what I was to do all summer. Cell culture, for the non biochemists/biologists is where the magic happens for cancer researchers (molecular and cell cancer researchers that is) 
<br> <img src="IMG_0674.jpg" alt="IMG" width="300" height="300"style="transform:rotate(90deg);"  ><br/>

<br> After work, I got my bike and was ready to go home. We got out early because Lisa was feeling a bit sick. I rode home on the path that I remembered from this morning and my google maps search. I actually took a video of the ride and myself.... but then I got lost. For some reason I took a right turn to early and ended up in altstadt Erlangen, far away from my actual apartment. Me being stubborn, I refused to use my phone maps to find my way home. I instead tried to find my own way home by riding around the city on my bike. It was a 2 hour adventure. It eventually started raining, and I still could not find my way home. I ended up just using maps on my Iphone and ended up home within 10 minutes. Although tiring, getting lost allowed me to get to know a little bit of the city and stop at a supermarket. <br/> 
<br> Nettos is a popular supermarket in Germany that that looks like Aldis. German supermarkets have lots of food, but I do not ever know what to buy. My first day I bought a salami pizza and a Mezzo mix. Mezzo mix is a cola/orange soda combination that is popular in Germany. When I got home, I cooked my pizza, drank my soda and did some MCAT studying. Then we were ready for another day. <br/>
</p>


<h2> Week 1 </h2>
<p> <br> Everyday this week has been pretty much the same. The next day for breakfast I went to a brezen meyer store. Brezen Meyer is another type of bakery here in Germany. I got a pretzel filled with creamcheese. Key dinner items I consumed are bratwurst, lasagna, tortellini, some bread and cheese. Most every day for lunch I went out with my research advisor and some research colleagues to lunch. Tuesday was rainy, so I had to take the bus. I ended up arriving late to the lab meeting on tuesday! This was embarassing, especially because I was to be introduced to the entire laboratory this day. <br/>
<br> This weekend was a bit uneventful. Saturday I took an MCAT practice exam during the day and went shopping. I also got a haircut. Funny thing is that the hairstyler did not speak very good english, so I got to practice some more German. Sunday I did more MCAT work. <br/>
 <p/>

<h2> Week 2 </h2>
<p> <br> Monday I went to kaiser wilhelm biergarten for lunch. Biergartens are the best types of restaurants in Germany in my opinion. Biergartens have beer and traditional german food. I ate a currywurst, a german sausage with spicy curry ketchup sauce on it. This is an absolute delicacy that I always look forward to. I planned to make a trip to nuremberg this weekend. Nuremberg is a nearby city to Erlangen, with a lot of history. <br/> 

<br> <img src="IMG_0649.jpg" alt="IMG" width="300" height="300" style="transform:rotate(90deg);"> <br/> 
<br> The nuremberg trip was awesome! I got up on saturday morning and got on the DB train toward nuremberg. I paid about 12.90 euros for a ticket for all day. In Germany the train stations are not heavily guarded and you could probably get by on the train without purchasing any tickets. I was on a tour of the city. I first arrived to the Hauptmarkt platz and went to find my tour guide. Free tours are really the best way to go anywhere you visit. I bought a Nürnberg t shirt from a man in a souvenir shop who interestingly enough spoke very good German Spanish and English. There was some sort of volleyball tournament in the center with lots of loud music.  Shortly after I went on the tour. Our tour guide was milicia, a Serbian history graduate student. We proceeded on a tour of the city. Nürnberg is closely associated with the Nuremberg trials from the 1945ish times and the NAZIs 
I got to nuremberg and took a bus to hauptmarkt, the central square of nuremberg. I also reserved a free tour of the city, that starts from hauptmarkt. Shortly after arriving at hauptmarkt, I bought a creamcheese pretzel and a chocolate milk.

<h2> Week 3 </h2>
<p> <br> Everyday this week has been pretty regular. This weekend was definitely a lazy one. Saturday I wanted to go to the bergwerk, a popular festival in Erlangen where people enjoy German culture, a carnival, and lots of beer as Germans do.  Saturday I did some MCAT studying and cooked then Sunday was another MCAT partly!!!!!  <br/>

 <p/>

<h2> Week 4 </h2>
<p> <br> Everyday this week has been pretty regular. I went to the Bergkirchweih festival with my lab group this week and went to the festial this weekend as well. During the week I went  to the berg with my research colleagues and we chatted and I ate some currywurst.  My flat mate Nazar invited me out with him and some other friends to go to the festival . It was really great! There were carnivals and music and lots of German food and in the night time it is much prettier. The next day as always was a lazy Saturday I spent most of it in my room sleeping. Sunday was another MCAT party, this time a little later than usual. 
 <br/>



<h2> Week 5 </h2>
<p> 
<br>
 This weekend I went to Munich.  
I always have wanted to return to Munich after my last time there. Munich to me holds a lot of interesting culture and history. I got on a flixbus and was on my way. This trip was rather long and I left in the very early morning so I was able to sleep some. After arriving at Munich I made a very stupid mistake. I was able to easily find the train but I forgot, I do not have a credit card or cash to pay for the ticket. So I had to run back up to the flixbus terminal and look for a dm store (drug store/market. Interestingly enough, my N26 bank account allows me to withdraw money from dm pharmacies across Germany without my card, instead using my phone. The only downside in my view is you must have internet to enjoy this benefit. Since using my plan is expensive in Germany ( $10 a day) I  keep my phone in airplane mode and use any WiFi I can get. So I ended up walking around for about 20-30 minutes looking for a pharmacy and some adequate WiFi. I finally found both and proceeded to withdraw cash and buy a ticket. I walked down to the train station again, $50 euro bill in my hand feeling Victorious, until I figured out I can only pay with small bills. So I ran back up to the store, bought food, got change, ran back down, waited 30 minutes for the next train and finally went to Marienplatz. Upon finally arriving at Marienplatz I was to locate my free tour guide (sandemans european tours). But before I did, I was awe stricken by this magnificent city square. I had to just stand and stare. There was a huge church/Rathaus structure in the center that was nothing like I have seen before in person. I located my guide, an English lady with an ear soothing accent. She married a man from Munich and lives there now, quite an interesting story. We embarked on the tour. One thing I forgot to mention about the tours is the people that are usually on them. In Nürnberg there were a few people from the US (Texas) and also Portugal, India etc. The interesting thing I learned about Europe living here for close to two months so far is that English is pretty much a universal language. Most of the free tours are offered in English and attract tourists whose native language is not usually spoken by the tour guides in any city from what I have seen. In Munich there were very diverse people on the tour. 

We walked down to many places. Viktualien markt is a square in Munich with many small stands with food vendors, souvenirs and a large bier garten. This bier garten is a place where people go and either buy food or bring their own food from home and eat and buy drinks from the brewery or restaurant that owns the tables. One rule: No one can bring their own drinks! We then walked around and saw many sites. I had to stop at the hofbrauhaus as well, a very famous brewery/restaurant in Munich. I then got on the zug and went to my flixbus stop. The ride home was also nice and I got home safely. Too bad I did not stay more time, but I have made it one of my goals to return to this great country again. You already know what comes next, MCAT party! 

<br/>
<p/>

<h2> Week 6 </h2>

<br>
 <p>  This was a short work week because Lisa had a conference. After working long hours lost everyday in the lab I usually get home very tired with not much desire/motivation to do anything. This is partly why in my mind, I did not plan as many trips as I now wish I did. But after conversing with Lisa about planes in the lab, she let me in on a little European secret. Ryanair. Ryanair is a very cheap airline. How cheap was it you ask? Cheap enough to fly me to Milan Italy from Nürnberg and back for 30€. I left Wednesday and returned Saturday. The flight over was nice, I slept most of the way but woke up when we where over the alps. The alps are absolutely amazing and I now want to go skiiing on them if I didn’t before.  My air bnb was close enough to the city to be adequate and was only 11€ a night ( steal). I got to the air bnb and was confused because instead of the guy i actually paid coming to check me in it was a short dark skinned chubby girl probably 15-16 years old with a baby. She did not speak English but did speak a little Spanish which saved me. This was unlike any hotel I have ever seen. In fact this was actually just an apartment with a combined small kitchen/ living room and three bed rooms which each had three bunk beds. Guess where I slept? On the top. Normally you don’t expect things to be this open but yeah there was little privacy. As I tried to pull my luggage into the room this little baby crawled in front of the door and blocked me. I kindly showed him to his rooom and settled in. In the rooom where some intimidating guys with tatoos and piercings and I just changed and slept. At this point my body temperature reached the threshold for sweating to commence because I started pouring sweat. I realized that it was unlike any tempearature I experienced in Europe so far, around 98 deg F. I took a cat nap and went to eat. I made the mistake of not bringing a handkerchief to wipe of my sweat because it was pouring. I found a place to eat on google maps and got on the bus and once I arrived I was still covered in sweat. I got to this small ristorante in Milan and was welcomed by 5-6 waiters/waitresses who were not very busy that night. I sat down and made some small talk, When i tell people I am from New York so that usually brings up some conversation. Bonjourno Poss avere un acqua naturale? Hello can I have a water? I asked and I got a nice meal. In Italy it is customary to have the courses. The appetizer first second then dessert. I ordered bruschetta appetizer which is buttered bread with chopped tomatoes. Rigatoni Pasta and lamb chops. The rigatoni was magnificent. I thought Olive Garden was good but this was real delicious authentic Italian food that puts Olive Garden to rest any day. Everything more than anything tasted natural ( tomatoes, wheat pasta, lamb meat) I finally fillled up and got the bill. I really wish I did not make such careless decisions while in Europe but I ended up paying 46€ for a meal for myself. Not a very good outcome. I to the bus and train back to my stay and had a hot sleep ( it was still very hot outside). The next day I went to my free tour of Milan at the duomo. The duomo is a large beautiful cathedral in Milan with lots of history. My tour guide was Marcos and he was very very passionate about this tour. So much so that he told people that were not fully engaged to leave the tour. It was ridiculously hot outside still and at  the conclusion of our tour I went to look for a train to the lake. A nice person at a Vodafone store allowed me to charge my dead phone. I got on the train to the artificial lake and I had some fun. The lake was a great way to cool off and not have to go too far. I then had some dinner at a pizza place on the way home, and finally had some authentic Italian pizza. I then got back to the air bnb and met some new guests. A girl from Oregon was there who was quite talkative. So much so that I pretty much just talked with her for the rest of the night. She was supposed to me the nanny for some people from Milan who found her in the us but things felll through and she was at the air bnb for a few days. I also met the other guys in the stay, one from Argentina the other from Italy. In Europe you meet people from all over the world, And most all are very friendly. The next day I went to the airport and flew back to Nürnberg. Quite the trip for me. I spent the Saturday studying a bit for the MCAT. Then my usual Sunday MCAT party followed.  </p> </br>

<h2> Week 7 </h2>
<p> 
<br>
This week was cut short because of the DAAD RISE student conference in heidelberg. The DAAD RISE holds a conference annually for all RISE students. Here we all gather together to learn more information about the program, get to know each other and have some fun! I left on friday morning on my usual flixbus and got to the Tiergartenstraße youth hostel in Heidelberg. As soon as I touched down I met some other RISE students and already had some roommates. The first day we went to a large hall and had some presentations/ speeches from ambassadors and rise professionals and had some music from a band. We had to all be bussed there which was pretty crowded but also made t hard not to find new friends. After the speeches we went back to the youth hostel where they had a barbecue, bratwurst and all. They also have us each two drink tickets, a pleasant surprise. Mezzomix was my drink of choice, a tasty soda blend of orange and cola that is very popular in germany. I then talked with some friends and went to the river and slept for the next day. The second day of the conference we have presentations from fellow rise students. We also got a nice tour of the city of heidelberg. The heidelberg schloss (castle) is definitely the best part of the city apart from the river. After the tour I went to a biergarten with some friends and then to the river to watch the sunset. German cities such as heideberg are nice because you can usually walk around with out fear of being a  victim of a crime. We returned to the youth hostel and I got ready for the early train trip back to Erlangen the next day.

<h2> Week 8 </h2>
<p> 
<br>
This weekend I went to stuttgart. A family friend lives in stuttgart to my previous suprise, and I was able to stay with them for the weekend. I went to the mercedes museum in stuttgart, a very awesome museum that documents much of the history of mercedes cars/ cars in general. After the tour I went to the city center where there was a huge open air jazz fest. I ate some indian food and caught the next train to my flixbus stop. I then went home comfortably on the flixbus.

<h2> Research: Week 1 </h2>
<p> Ever heard of HeLa cells? These were taken from Henrietta Lacks, a cervical cancer patient, and cultured for many generations. TILL THIS DAY. I have Hela cells at my disposal at this very institute. Cancer cells are great for cell and molecular biology researchers because with proper care, these cells never die. I picked up on proper cell culture techniques from my undergraduate University lab, and was happy to see some familiar things in the institute laboratory. I was able        <p/>
<h2> Research: Week 2 </h2>
<p>   Then when doing the transfer of my MV3DC CRISPR Cas9 Clones to a 96-well plate, my hands were very shaky. I do not know what this might have been from, but I was just in cell culture before lunch and did not have this shaky hand problem. As a result, I probably ended up getting some heterogenous cell populations in some of the wells. Hopefully these are all bi-allelic deletion clones! Research techniques can be difficult if you 1) Are not paying close attention to every single detail and 2) If you can not concentrate on manual tasks/ have shaky hands.   <p/>
<h2> Research: Comments</h2>
<p>     
    As a RISE student I get to attend literature seminars/ lab meetings with all the PhD students and PIs (AG Iin German) these are great when they are in English, sometimes they are in German. One thing that I can never get used to is not clapping but knocking. At the end of a presentation everyone knocks on their desks, but I instead proceed to slap together my big American hands and get confused looks at me every time.
